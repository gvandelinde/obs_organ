## General guideline
```
Identifying requirements for your system
Make a design for your system (vague, what does that mean?)
Prototype your design.
Evaluate your system.
```


## Througout the Project
- Describe perspectives and values of _different_ stakeholders (not only target group)
- The systems needs to be __explicitly targeted__ at the target group though!

## System evaluation
- Have one _experimental user-evaluation_ of the system.
