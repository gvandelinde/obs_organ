# Competence
**increase:**
- If the human communicates his search for a room, and along the line, it is followed by a message of finding a victim and then rescuing the victim.
**decrease:**
- Not communicating the rescue of a victim.
# Willingness
**increase:**
- Coming to assist the robot on carrying a mildly injured victim.
**decrease:**
- Not responding to the questions of the robot in a timely fashion.
- Respond to the robots question fo help(like carrying critical victim) with something unrelated and not coming ot help.



Note: we Assume that competence is a measure of how good the human is at performing its own tasks with communication and willingness as the measure of how eager the human is to come help the robot.
