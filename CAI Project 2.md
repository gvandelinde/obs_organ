General remark: we want to scale the amount of change over the times these event are deceted. This would distinguish a small error from deliberate malintended behavior, and allow for forgiveness.

# Competence

- If the human communicates his search for a room, and along the line, it is followed by a message of finding a victim or obstacle in that room.
- and then rescuing the victim. (i.e. when a human performs a succesfull rescue)
- W

**decrease:**
- Not communicating the rescue of a victim.
- If an agent says they've done someone, but it hasn't.
- Whenever a search isn't announced but there was searching done.
- When the human agent requests assitstance, but there is none needed. 

# Willingness
**increase:**
- Coming to assist the robot on carrying a mildly injured victim.
- Coming to assist the robot on carrying a mildly injured victim.
**decrease:**
- Not responding to the questions of the robot in a timely fashion.
- Respond to the robots question fo help(like carrying critical victim) with something unrelated and not coming ot help.


```
Note: we Assume that competence is a measure of how good the human is at performing its own tasks with communication and willingness as the measure of how eager the human is to come help the robot.
